Do not touch anything unless I say so dummy!
This is my code if you want to use parts of it thats fine but if you want to use the whole thing credit me please.

Instructions!
1. Find some sort of image youd like to convert and drop it into this folder
2. IT WILL BE IN THE SAME FOULDER AS THIS TEXT
3. Run the code. It will ask you for the file name so enter it including the type of file it is such as example.png or test.jpg
4. Questions will come up asking for things as materials or if you would like to inver the colors. you can just answer no
5. WHEN IT ASKS FOR CONTRASTS LISTEN you will have to dial it in for a better image I recommend doing 128 first and seeing how well it comes out. If Its not good try like 200 or 100 and see what happens. If it gets better or worse. Base your number off what you want.
6. Output.txt will update everytime so if you want to save your masterpiece copy the file and move it elsewhere.
7. Once you have the file you can name it whatever its just a text file.
